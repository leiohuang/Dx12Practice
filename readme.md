# D3D12 practice
This project is based on Microsfts&copy; [MiniEngine](https://github.com/microsoft/DirectX-Graphics-Samples/tree/master/MiniEngine). Besides that I add some toy demos

## Gpu Tiles Culling:
* Accelerate draw-calle submitions by GPU-based tiles culling and using indirect draw calls. Each color block is a quad draw. The shape is inspaird by [Heart - 2D](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XsfGRn)
